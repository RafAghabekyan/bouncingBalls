Bouncing Ballz

Web application written with html5 canvas, where users can click on the screen to spawn a circle with different colors. The circle realistically obey Earth-like gravity, moving vertically and bouncing upon hitting the bottom of the screen, with a dampening effect on each bounce until it comes to a stop. There can be multiple circle instances on screen at a time.
